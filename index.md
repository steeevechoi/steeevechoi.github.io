### CPSC 120

* [Lab 10](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-10-steve-and-justin/tree/main/part-1/)

    Lab 10, part 1 was one of my favorite labs because this is where we learned how to sort through files/vectors and to check if they were specific numbers, prime to be exact.

* [Lab 11](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-11-liz-and-steve/)

    Lab 11, both parts was one of the more fun labs that we had done and one of the first ones I did entirely alone. It kind of was a test for myself and how much I under how to code and trace it as well. I learned the most from this lab and for that, it is one of my most memorable. Especially since classes were confusing but I ended up undestanding them as I spent more time with them.

* [Lab 7](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-07-steve-and-evan/)

    Lab , part was an interesting one as we had to use two Julian dates and subtract them with each other to find the difference in days from each other. This lab came mind because I remember that the there were a few test where the number of days would come out negative and I thought it was wrong. I remember walking home thinking about how to fix it to become positive.
